            <p>
              For Persian immigrant Ali Rad, Sr., arriving in Tampa, FL, with his four young sons meant searching for opportunity and a better life. 
              On Dec. 17, 1903, he helped to open the Persian Saloon, which became the Adina Restaurant in 1990.
              Over nearly 33 years, the original restaurant has expanded to an entire city block and is now the largest Persian restaurant in the world. Ali Rad's descendants diligently care for the Adina Restaurant and help preserve his American dream. As Florida’s oldest Persian restaurant, the Adina has seven locations in Florida and is still owned and operated by family members.
